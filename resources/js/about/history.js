    <p>
      Cvsu-CCC is located in Pulo II, Dalahican, Cavite City. 
      The campus was established as a timely response of the Cavite 
      provincial government to the needs of the people in lowland 
      town of Cavite for a good quality education at affordable cost. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Through Resolution No.153 s. 2000 which was later amended by 
      Resolution No. 540 s. 2000, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan 
      authorized then provincial Governor Ramon Revilla to negotiate 
      and enter into agreement with the Development Bank of the Philippines 
      for loan application for the purpose of establishing the Cavite 
      State University-Cavite City Campus. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Through loan granted, the former Columbia College was rehabilitated 
      which paved the way for the operation of the present campus. 
      The campus initially offered three courses namely: Bachelor of Science 
      in Computer Science, Bachelor of Science in Business Management 
      and Associate in Computer Education. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Its enrolment of 230 during of first semester of SY 2001-2002 was reduced 
      to 203 during the second semester. Likewise, Bachelor of Elementary Education 
      and Bachelor or Secondary Education majors in English and Mathematics were 
      offered during the first semester of SY 2002-2003 with only 17 students.
    </p>
    <p>
      To date the population has increased 2400. Despite the number of lapses, 
      difficulties and problem, the campus is going strong. This made possible 
      through the kind assistance and supervision of the administration of the 
      university, the Cavite provincial government, Cavite City local government 
      unit and the present personnel of the campus.
